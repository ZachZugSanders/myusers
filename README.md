# MyUsers

I wanted to create an application that stores my username and password information for...fun?
Am I having fun? I suppose... I am just exercising my brain in a way that isn't playing video games.

This project is going to use SQLite to store my information. I want to do a little ORM instead of using
SQLAlchemy mainly because I hate that package and just hate databases in general.

The main file in this project is a console input at the moment but once I get the bones going perhaps I'll
add a real interface.
